1. Does your program output any garbage? If yes, why?

     Yes, the program prints out garbage values. We expected the program to print almost all the number from 1 to 2000 or count, as we run a loop but that’s not the case. 
     Instead most of the time just 2000 is consumed and printed, this is happening because both producer and consumer are two independent processes and there’s no 
     synchronization between them.

2.   Are all the produced values getting consumed? Check your program for a small count like 20.

      No, all the produced values are not getting consumed even for a smaller count like 20. The producer function runs too fast and exits the loop while the consumer function
      is waiting. Hence, when the consumer function resumes, the value of n is already set to the count.
